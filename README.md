# [NMRiH] Workshop ID Validator
This plugin fixes an oversight in No More Room in Hell 1.11.4 where Workshop maps are replicated to clients without prior validation. This leads to scenarios where clients are required to download a map on connect, but the map in question is unavailable, making the server unjoinable as a result.
